# Advancing-Liver-Tumor-Segmentation
This project introduces a cutting-edge approach for liver tumor segmentation using a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) integrated with attention mechanisms. The framework addresses challenges in medical imaging, such as low tumor contrast and complex morphologies, by enhancing feature extraction and improving segmentation accuracy.
